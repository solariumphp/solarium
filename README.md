# Solarium PHP Solr Client Library

## What is Solarium?

Solarium is a PHP Solr client library that accurately models Solr concepts. Where many other Solr libraries only handle
the communication with Solr, Solarium also relieves you of handling all the complex Solr query parameters using a
well documented API.

Please see the [docs](http://solarium.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for a more detailed description.

## Requirements

Solarium 6.1.x only supports PHP 7.3 and up.

It's highly recommended to have cURL enabled in your PHP environment. However if you don't have cURL available you can
switch from using cURL (the default) to a pure PHP based HTTP client adapter which works for the essential stuff but
doesn't support things like parallel query execution.

Alternatively you can inject any PSR-18 compatible HTTP Client using the `Psr18Adapter`.

## Getting started

The preferred way to install Solarium is by using Composer. Solarium is available on
[Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/solarium/solarium).

Example:
```
composer require solarium/solarium
```

### Pitfall when using PHP versions prior to PHP 8.0

If you are using a PHP version prior to PHP 8.0 *and* a locale that uses a decimal separator that's different
from a decimal point, float values are sent in a way that Solr doesn't understand. This is due to the string
representation of floats in those PHP versions.

You can work around this by setting the `'C'` locale before creating and sending requests to Solr. Don't forget
to set it back to the original value if your application is locale-dependent.

```php
// make sure floats use "." as decimal separator
$currentLocale = setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, 0);
setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, 'C');

/*
 * Create and send the requests you want Solarium to send.
 */

// restore the locale
setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, $currentLocale);
```

PHP 8.0 has made the float to string conversion locale-independent and will always use the `.` decimal separator.
The workaround is no longer necessary with PHP versions â‰¥ 8.0.

### Pitfall when upgrading from 3.x or 4.x or 5.x

Setting "timeout" as "option" in the HTTP Client Adapter is deprecated since Solarium 5.2.0 because not all adapters
could handle it. The adapters which can handle it now implement the `TimeoutAwareInterface` and you need to set the
timeout using the `setTimeout()` function after creating the adapter instance.

In order to fix some issues with complex queries using local parameters Solarium 6 distinguishes between query parameters
and local parameters to be embedded in a query. Solarium 5.2 already informed you about the deprecation of some
parameter names which are in fact local parameters. Solarium doen't convert them magically anymore.
Local parameter names now have to be prefixed with `local_` if set as option of a constructor.

Solarium 5:
```php
$categoriesTerms = new Solarium\Component\Facet\JsonTerms(['key' => 'categories', 'field' => 'cat', 'limit'=>4,'numBuckets'=>true]);
```

Solarium 6:
```php
$categoriesTerms = new Solarium\Component\Facet\JsonTerms(['local_key' => 'categories', 'field' => 'cat', 'limit'=>4,'numBuckets'=>true]);
```

See https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/local-parameters-in-queries.html for an introduction about local parameters.


### Pitfall when upgrading from 3.x or 4.x

In the past, the V1 API endpoint **_solr_** was not added automatically, so most users set it as path on the endpoint.
This bug was discovered with the addition of V2 API support. In almost every setup, the path has to be set to `/`
instead of `/solr` with this release!

For the same reason it is a must to explicit configure the _core_ or _collection_.

So an old setting like
```
'path' => '/solr/xxxx/'
```
has to be changed to something like
```
'path' => '/',
'collection' => 'xxxx',
```

## Run the examples

To run the examples read through the _Example code_ section of
https://solarium.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started/

## Run the tests

The phpunit tests contain some integration tests that require a running Solr instance. And this Solr instance requires
some special configuration.
Have a look at `.github/workflows/run-tests.yml` to see how to start a well configured Solr docker container locally.
If you just want to run the unit tests, just ensure that there's no other Solr server listening on the standard port
8983 and the integration tests will be skipped.

You can run the tests in a Windows environment. For all of them to pass, you must make sure to
[checkout with `LF` line endings](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings).
