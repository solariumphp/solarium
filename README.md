# Solarium PHP Solr client library


## What is Solarium?

Solarium is a PHP Solr client library that accurately model Solr concepts. Where many other Solr libraries only handle
the communication with Solr, Solarium also relieves you of handling all the complex Solr query parameters using a
well documented API.

Please see the project website for a more detailed description.

## Requirements

Solarium only supports PHP 5.3 and up.
It's highly recommended to have Curl enabled in your PHP environment. However if you don't have Curl available you can
switch from using Curl (the default) to another client adapter. The other adapters don't support all the features of the
Curl adapter.

## Getting started

The preferred way to install Solarium is by using Composer. Solarium is available on Packagist.
