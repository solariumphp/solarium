For a general description of components see this page: [Components](V3:Components "wikilink")

In a select query result object you can get a component result in two ways:

-   by using the `getComponent` method
-   by using one of the component-specific `get` methods, for instance `getFacetSet`

In the following sections the available component results will be described. No every component has a result, for instance the DisMax component only influences how the query is executed, but has no result (other than the normal query response).
