// Note: for this example on a default Solr index (with a tiny index) the performance gain is minimal to none.
// With a bigger dataset, more complex queries or multiple solr instances the performance gain is much more.
// For testing you can use a Solr delay component (see https://github.com/basdenooijer/raspberry-solr-plugins) to
// artificially slow Solr down by an exact amount of time.
