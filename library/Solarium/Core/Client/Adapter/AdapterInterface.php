 * Interface for client adapters
 *
 * The goal of an adapter is to accept a query, execute it and return the right
 * result object. This is actually quite a complex task as it involves the
 * handling of all Solr communication.
 *
 * The adapter structure allows for varying implementations of this task.
 *
 * Most adapters will use some sort of HTTP client. In that case the
 * query request builders and query response parsers can be used to simplify
 * HTTP communication.
 *
 * However an adapter may also implement all logic by itself if needed.
