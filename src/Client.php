     * A major release is used for significant release with architectural
     * changes and changes that might break backwards compatibility
     *
     * A minor release adds and enhances features, and might also contain
     * bugfixes. It should be backwards compatible, or the incompatibilities
     * should be clearly documented with the release.
     *
     * A mini release only contains bugfixes to existing features and is always
     * backwards compatible.
     *
     * If you develop your application to a specific Solarium version it is best
     * to check for that exact major and minor version, leaving the mini version
     * open to allow for upgrades in case of bugfixes.
